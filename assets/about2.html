<h1>Interstellar</h1>
<p>
    Interstellar is a 2014 epic science fiction drama film directed, written, and produced by Christopher Nolan and starring Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, Ellen Burstyn, Michael Caine, and Matt Damon. Set in a dystopian future where humanity is embroiled in a catastrophic blight and famine, the film follows a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole near Saturn in search of a new home for humankind.

<h2>Plot</h2>
<p>
    In 2067, humanity is facing extinction following a global famine caused by ecocide.[7] Joseph Cooper, a former NASA test pilot, along with his son and daughter, Tom and Murph, and father-in-law Donald, are farmers, like most of humanity. One evening, during a dust storm, Cooper and Murph discover a gravitational anomaly in Murph's bedroom that has left patterns of falling particles. The pattern leads them to a secret NASA facility, where Cooper gets enlisted by the lead scientist, Brand, as the pilot of their latest mission, which will take them beyond the galaxy in search of new habitable planets. This can now be achieved via a mysterious wormhole − another anomaly − near Saturn, leading to a faraway planetary system orbiting Gargantua, a supermassive black hole.

    Cooper struggles to leave his children behind, but decides to do it in the hope of saving Tom and Murph's generation from extinction. He promises Murph to return, but she is distraught. Cooper joins the Endurance team, consisting of Romilly, Doyle, and Brand's daughter Amelia − and two intelligent robots, TARS and CASE. After years of travel, the crew enters the wormhole and arrives at the first candidate planet in the new galaxy, only to find that it is an ocean world with massive tidal waves caused by Gargantua's intense gravitational pull. Doyle is swept away and killed by a wave. Cooper and Amelia narrowly survive, but are delayed returning to the Endurance. Due to time dilation, 23 years have passed onboard and on Earth during their absence from the craft. On Earth in 2092, an adult Murph helps Brand with his perennially unsolved gravity manipulation equation, which is supposed to help transport humanity en masse to potentially habitable worlds.

    On his deathbed, Brand confesses that the equation was a charade, meant to keep humans from dissolving into anarchy out of panic for their eventual doom. Murph is frustrated and wonders if Cooper knowingly abandoned her. She decides to continue his work, and returns to her childhood home to search for clues. On the second candidate planet, the Endurance crew is met by a harsh ice world. They awaken Mann, the surviving NASA explorer in cryostasis, who landed here a decade ago. Mann and Cooper go on a scouting trip, but once alone, Mann confesses that the planet is uninhabitable and that he falsified data to attract rescuers. He tries to kill Cooper but fails. Amelia is pulled into rescuing Cooper, leading Romilly to die at the base by an explosive trap left by Mann. Mann takes off in a lander, attempting to hijack the Endurance, but is killed by a failed docking maneuver. Cooper and Amelia chase down the damaged spacecraft, and narrowly dock with it though they have limited fuel remaining and are falling into the black hole.

    Charting a gravity-assist path around Gargantua, Cooper propels the craft towards the third and final planet, causing another 51 years to dilate. Ignoring Amelia's protestations, he detaches the two heavy auxiliary craft carrying himself and TARS so that Amelia's mass-reduced craft may safely reach the final planet. Beyond the black hole's event horizon, Cooper falls into a four-dimensional tesseract, where time is a physical dimension. He uses gravity to communicate with Murph and his past self, and realizes he sent the NASA coordinates to himself, thereby initiating this mission. He deduces that a future generation created the tesseract to similarly guide humankind. Cooper eventually enables Murph to solve the gravity equation by sending her the quantum data captured by TARS inside the singularity. Murph comes across the information encoded in Cooper's wristwatch, which she finds while visiting the family home. She saves humanity by successfully developing gravity manipulation. The tesseract dissolves, ejecting Cooper and TARS back into Saturn's orbit, where they are rescued in 2156 by humans inside a massive O'Neill cylinder named after Murph. When he finally reunites with his daughter, who is now relatively much older than him, she tells him not to wait around for her to die and to seek out Amelia instead. Cooper commandeers a spacecraft and sets off on another solo mission with TARS.

Meanwhile, on the final candidate planet, Amelia sets up a new colony with the help of robots. She surveys the landscape and removes her helmet, breathing in the air of the new habitable world.
