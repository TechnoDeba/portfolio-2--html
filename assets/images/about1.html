<h2>Plot</h2>
<p>
    In 2009, Harsha is a street-bike racer who is traveling on an auto with his friend to the airport. He spots the blurry outline of a woman trying to flag the auto down and gestures to her that it is already occupied. As he does, their fingers accidentally touch, and Harsha feels an electric current passing through him, which triggers a few fleeting images. After recovering from the shock, he flees the auto in search of the girl and inquires about her to a woman named Indira "Indu", unaware that Indu is the same woman. Indu, thinking he is stalking her, misdirects him by convincing him that the girl is her neighbor. She and her friends exploit Harsha, having him take them to places and promising that the girl will show. After Harsha beats up a group of men who were verbally harassing Indu, she starts to fall in love with him.

    It is then revealed that Indu was raised in Hyderabad because her father, Pratap Varma, was evicted from their ancestral estate in Rajasthan, where the 15th-century kingdom of Udaigarh used to stand. The property was seized by Pratap's late younger sister's husband, who after her death had no right to the estate. After killing many lawyers, the brother-in-law and his son, Raghuveer, go to Hyderabad to kill him, but Raghuveer falls in love with Indu after seeing her beauty and body. Raghuveer's father calls him silly, to which Raghuveer murders him and then manipulates Indu and her father into thinking his father died of old age and offering them the estate again, as well as trusting him. However, when he attempts to touch a sleeping Indu, he sees visions of a warrior slitting his throat. Raghuveer consults a tantrik, Ghora, who reveals that in a prior life, Raghuveer was a prince who lusted after Indu and was killed by her lover, a warrior. Raghuveer is determined to find the reincarnation of the warrior and kill him. Meanwhile, Harsha discovers how Indu and her friends have been tricking him, and after he pranks her in retaliation, they start to fall in love. Raghuveer discovers that Harsha is the reincarnation of the warrior, murders Indu's father, and frames Harsha. As Raghuveer and Indu leave in a helicopter, Harsha fails to catch them; falling into a lake, he faces a near-death experience and gets a full vision of his past life in 1609 CE.

    <h4>Past:</h4> In 1609, Emperor Sher Khan is preparing to invade the kingdom of Udaigarh when he hears of the brave warrior Kala Bhairava (Harsha). King Vikram Singh's daughter and heir, Yuvaraani Mithravinda Devi (Indu), loves Bhairava, but he holds himself back even though he reciprocates her feelings. Ranadev Billa (Raghuveer), the royal general as well as the son of Vikram Singh's late sister and brother-in-law, lusts after Mithra, thus his cousin, and plans a competition between himself and Bhairava; the winner will marry the princess and the loser will be banished from Udaigarh. Bhairava's victory leads to Ranadev's banishment. Vikram Singh, however, secretly requests Bhairava not to marry his daughter, because Bhairava will likely die, like his ancestors, in the coming battle with Khan's forces, and he does not wish to see Mithra widowed. Though shocked, Bhairava concedes to the king's request and publicly declines to marry Mithra, leaving her distraught.

    Bhairava takes Mithra, his soldiers, and his caretakers to the Bhairavakona Temple atop a cliff to seek blessings from Lord Shiva before the attack. Mithra demands that Bhairava admit his love for her. When he does not respond, she upsets the sacred items they have brought for the puja and, using her blood, paints an image of Bhairava on a rock picturing him leaving his true love to do his duty. An injured soldier arrives to tell Bhairava that Ranadev has aided Khan's army, who have killed Vikram Singh and are now rushing toward them. They arrive, and Khan challenges Bhairava to kill at least 100 of his soldiers. Bhairava completes the challenge but is severely injured in the battle. Khan, impressed by Bhairava's bravery, has a change of heart and accepts him as his friend. However, Ranadev, invoking Khan's promise to aid him in victory, continues attacking, eventually stabbing Mithra in the stomach before being decapitated by Bhairava. A dying Mithra asks Bhairava to confess his love, but before he can respond, she dies and falls off the cliff. Distraught, he jumps off as well, following her to meet the same fate.

    <h4>Present:</h4> Harsha is rescued by a fisherman named Solomon (the reincarnation of Sher Khan) from Srikakulam and, with Solomon's help, visits Srikakulam where he fell to Udaigarh. He reaches Raghuveer's palace and overhears Aghora telling Raghuveer that if Indu's past-life memories are not revived within the day they never can be, and she will be with Raghuveer forever. Harsha kidnaps Indu, with Solomon aiding him, and takes her to the Bhairavakona Temple, now in a dilapidated state, and the process, Raghuveer accidentally kills Aghora. Raghuveer arrives by helicopter and asks Indu to come with him; however Indu sees Mithra's painting, and her past-life memories are revived. She reunites with Harsha and asks him to forgive her. An angered Raghuveer attacks Harsha who fights him, and with the help of Solomon, manages to kill him and the couple reunites.
