  A true sports enthusiast, I love both playing and watching cricket. I am an ardent fan of MS Dhoni and Virat Kohli, admiring Dhoni's iconic helicopter shot and Kohli's exquisite cover drive, which have fueled my passion for the sport. In addition to cricket, I enjoy watching football and idolize Cristiano Ronaldo for his incredible skills and dedication to the game
